          <h2>Why This Site Exists</h2>
          <p>
            Militarization of the police. Police brutality. Crime statistics. Excessive force. For many, these are mere buzzwords—just another passing headline. Some might argue that the gravity of these words are not as eye-catching as gossip about the latest hot celebrity. And even if you're able to move beyond the headline, the data may be messy and confusing, much less motivating.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bringing Buzzwords Home exists to help you contextualize some of today’s most important and contentious issues. Reshape how you see and understand your world, by moving past the headline and seeing how your own community is affected by crime and weapons. How many fatal encounters with the police have occurred in your own area? How much free military equipment has your state's police force received from the U.S. government? What are the violent and property crime statistics in your county? Bringing Buzzwords Home has synthesized nearly half a million critical data points into one cohesive and accessible site.

            The first step in civic engagement is understanding what’s happening at home.
